# Overview

Collect events for [Janus](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway).

This server is dead simple for now, received events can be written to console,
or dumped to a file.

Check out config.sample.js for the (currently very limited) config options.

## Installation
 - ```npm install```
 - Copy ```config.sample.js``` to ```config.js```, edit to taste.
 - ```node app.js```
